# SimpleButtonJS
## _Simple js-button for Tampermonkey / Violentmonkey / Greasemonkey_

A very simple way to create a button for any site using browser add-ons. The button itself will be not embedded in the webpage, but sits anywhere on top of it (like a layer). 

P.S.: Many people write on the Internet that making a button in a browser add-on is difficult or it doesn't work at all, but that's not true! Have fun! :)
